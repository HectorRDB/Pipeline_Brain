# Pipeline to analyse the allen datasets

The aim of this project is to discover stable clusters shared by all MOp datasets. There are 6 datasets:

+ SMARTer_cells_MOp
+ SMARTer_nuclei_MOp
+ 10x_cells_MOp (V2)
+ 10x_nuclei_MOp (V2)
+ 10x_v3_cells_MOp
+ 10x_v3_nuclei_MOp

We follow this workflow for each dataset:
