# Pipeline to analyse the allen datasets

The aim of this project is to discover stable clusters shared by all MOp datasets. There are four datasets:

+ SMARTer_cells_MOp
+ SMARTer_nuclei_MOp
+ 10x_cells_MOp
+ 10x_nuclei_MOp

We follow this workflow for each dataset:

The data is pre-processed (steps 1 to 3) and then 4 clustering methods are run (step 4 to 7). Finally, we run our newly developped ARI merging procedure. Scripts to run those steps are in the *Scripts* folder. Output of step 8 (used for downstream analysis) can be found in the *data* folder. The subfolder *Scripts/Helper* serves as a sandbox.

Reports for each individual dataset can be generated by running the script render.sh in the Report folder. As of 05/15, only reports for the two Smart-Seq datasets are available.
